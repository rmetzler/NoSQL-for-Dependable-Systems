	The fault model for very large e-commerce
	websites like Amazon is fundamentally different from standard
	websites. These websites loose money when the aren't available (or
	just slow) for potential customers but can't risk to loose any
	data. The data has to be replicated between databases but
	traditional RDBMSs may not fit. This paper discusses some of the
	better known NoSQL software products available today
