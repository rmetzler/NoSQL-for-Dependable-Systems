	The fault model for very large e-commerce
  websites like Amazon is fundamentally different from standard
  websites. Any downtime has direct influence on sales but component failures occure frequently.
  To maximize reliability, data should be replicated between databases. 
  This paper discusses problems that arise when using distributed database systems.
  Furthermore we test how some of the more popular NoSQL database systems replicate data and increase dependability.
