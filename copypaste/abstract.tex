	The fault model for very large e-commerce
	websites like Amazon is fundamentally different from standard
	websites. Any downtime has direct influence on sales but component failures occure frequently.
	To maximize reliability, data should be replicated between databases. 
	This paper discusses some of the more popular NoSQL database
	systems and how they fit in terms of dependability.
