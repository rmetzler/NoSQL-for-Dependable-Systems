  abstract = {{This} new edition represents a significant update of the best-selling book, incorporating and anticipating the major developments in distributed systems technology. All chapters have been thoroughly revised and updated, including emphasis on the Internet, intranets, and middleware. New material includes coverage of large-scale applications, fault modeling and fault tolerance, models of system execution, object-orientation, and distributed multimedia systems. Discussion of security has also been brought forward in the book and integrated with other related technologies. The book includes a new chapter on distributed multimedia systems, and also provides new material on current network technologies such as {IPv6,} Mobile {IP,} and active and wireless networks. Throughout, Java and {CORBA} are used as the basis for most examples. This book is designed for programmers who need to learn the principles and practice of distributed system design. Readers should have an understanding of programming and elementary computer architecture, as well as a familiarity with basic operating system concepts, but the book does not require knowledge of networks.}
